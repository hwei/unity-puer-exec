## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Health response exposes endpoint identity

The Unity-side health endpoint SHALL expose enough identity for a project-scoped caller to verify endpoint ownership and installation consistency. A ready health response SHALL include the selected port, base URL, Unity process id when available, resolved Unity project path, session marker, and the bridge package version. The bridge version SHALL be resolved from the Unity package metadata for the assembly providing the service, and SHALL be omitted or reported as null when that assembly does not belong to an installed package rather than reported as a guessed value.

#### Scenario: Caller probes a ready service

- **WHEN** a caller probes `/health` on a ready UnityPuerExec service
- **THEN** the response includes `status = "ready"`
- **AND** the response includes `port`, `base_url`, `unity_pid`, `project_path`, `session_marker`, and `bridge_version`

#### Scenario: Caller compares endpoint ownership

- **WHEN** a caller has a target project path and receives a ready health response from a candidate endpoint
- **THEN** the caller can compare the health `project_path` with the target project path
- **AND** a mismatch identifies the candidate endpoint as not owned by the target project

#### Scenario: Caller compares installation consistency

- **WHEN** a caller receives a ready health response and knows its own CLI version
- **THEN** the caller can compare the health `bridge_version` with its own version
- **AND** a difference identifies the two product halves as a mixed installation

#### Scenario: Service assembly is not package-installed

- **WHEN** the Editor assembly providing the service does not belong to an installed Unity package
- **THEN** the health response omits `bridge_version` or reports it as null
- **AND** the response remains otherwise well-formed so callers can still evaluate endpoint ownership
